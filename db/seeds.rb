    content: "It may only be the start of 2021, but today Omega set the tone for its year, unveiling the latest update to its iconic Speedmaster Professional Moonwatch. The Moonwatch— which is best known for accompanying NASA astronauts in their journeys to the watch’s namesake celestial body from 1969 and onward — is today one of the watch world’s most recognizable models.

The most substantial upgrades are the inclusion of a new Master Chronometer-certified movement — 2019’s Caliber 3861, which replaces the Moonwatch’s previous standard Caliber, the 1861 — as well as several new case-material options.",

Last year saw the release of two historically inspired variations on Zenith’s famed El Primero from 1969, one based on the Ref. A384 (here), the other on Ref. A386. This year, Zenith revisits (you guessed it) the Ref. A385 from that same seminal year — which featured, according to the Le Locle-based manufacturer, the watch industry’s first “smoked” gradient-effect dial.",

    title: "Cyber Skull",
    content: "French-founded Bell & Ross is known for its creative designs and unique takes on the aviation-influenced, square-cased style that the company pioneered with the BR 01 collection. The BR 01 Concept Skull series, in particular, has showcased some of Bell & Ross’s most playful offerings in recent years, and its skull-and-crossbones motif has become a signature look for the watchmaker.
